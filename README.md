# feareater
A page that accepts your fears, eats them, and gives back hearts. 

# Usage

Visit the site and enter in a fear/anxiety/worry that's been weighing on you.  When you press enter, the site will take the fear, chew it up, and slowly digest it until it's gone.  Then it shows it's love back to you with a nice emoji heart.

# How and Why this was written

It was written using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), solely because I wanted to learn how both of these things work.  

The second goal is to be able to host this site on beaker, so it can be forked for people's personal use (or it can be removed, if the feareater is done and don't want visitors anymore).  

It was also written using the js library [lodash](https://lodash.com/) because I like the name and wanna see what it does.
